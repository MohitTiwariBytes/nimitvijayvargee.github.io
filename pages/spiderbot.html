            <h2>The Parts</h2><br/>
            Parts sourcing was a necessary part of this project. The robot must be able to follow lines and
            control and Ultrasonic sensor. <br><br>
            The main computer is going to be a Raspberry Pi Pico W. This is because the Pico can handle all these criteria and
            has internet access allowing me to control the robot remotely. <br><br>
            The power source is a 4.7v 18650 battery, charged and protected with a TP4056 module. <br><br>
            The voltage range provided is quite low to drive BO motors, so I have chosen an N20 Metal geared motor.
            As for the motor driver, I wanted to use the L293D / L298N modules due to their convinience but sadly they both are
            too high voltage requirements. Thus, I have chosen the MX1508 Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver. <br><br>
            I also wanted a screen on the robot because that sounds very cool, so I have chosen the ST7735R 1.8" TFT LCD. <br><br>
            The line detection system is an array of 8 IR Sensors (TCRT-5000). The Ultrasonic Sensor is a backup so the robot does not 
            run into any walls. The sensor will be mounted onto a servo so that it can be rotated to detect the room it is placed in.
