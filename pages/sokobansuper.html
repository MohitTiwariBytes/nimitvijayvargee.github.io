            <h2>The Sprites</h2><br>
            The game uses many sprites, despite looking so simple. 
            The player is comprised of 4 sub-sprites for each direction. 
            This allows the player to look more dynamic when moving. 
            The boxes turn into walls when pushed for convinience,
            because I didn't bother with making the boxes solid when in the hole. <br><br>

            The game will keep 2 extra sprite holders: PlayerDirection and the PreviousDirection.
            This lets me replace the player with a new sprite facing in the desired direction.
            As for level design, most levels are easy but feel free to create some of your own!
            Level 10 was a fun one because it took barely much time to make but a long time to playtest. <br><br>
            I am also working on a teleporter which can transport boxes and even the player to new places on the map, although the screen is to small to work on any larger maps.
            Here is what the teleporter sprite looks like! <br>

            Clearly not my best work :(
